Hi, this is Wenkai Shi. I was born in Liyang, Jiangsu, and now live in Suzhou. It was lucky for me that I  grew up healthy and sound with the cultivation of my parents and teachers. In 2011, I entered [Suzhou High School SIP](http://shssip.szedu.com/2016en_dtlpage.asp?c=231) which is one of the top high schools in Suzhou. In 2012, I got an opportunity to study at a Japanese high school with a full scholarship. So I decided to come to Japan and entered [Gyosei International School](http://www.gis.ac.jp/). After my graduation, I was addmitted to [Ibaraki University](http://www.ibaraki.ac.jp/) in 2015. I chose Intelligent System as my major. Then I became Interested in DeepLearnig and started to research Textual Analysis of Stock Market Behavior Using Financial News Headlines as a member of [Suzuki Lab](http://tsuzuki.ise.ibaraki.ac.jp/TS_lab/index-e.html). I have a wide range of interests, such as building WebCrawlers, listening to music, watching movies and photographing, etc. I would like to be friends with everyone. Please feel free to contact me.
